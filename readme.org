#+TITLE: A maintained SeqLib for interface to htslib only

[[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/SeqLib/actions/workflows/mac.yml/badge.svg]]

This is a fork of https://github.com/walaj/SeqLib.

Features :
- *only dependency is htslib*.
- compatibility with arm for mac M- chip
- no fancy functionality (e.g ssw) other than API to BAM files.
- add [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/vcfpp][vcfpp.h]] for API to VCF/BCF files.

* Installation

For a quick and full installation, just do

#+begin_src shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Zilong-Li/SeqLib.git
cd SeqLib
autoreconf -i # build the configure script and install files it uses
./configure
make
#+end_src

Now you can integrate SeqLib into your project as the following:

#+begin_src shell
SEQ=<path_to_seqlib_git_repos>
C_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH:$SEQ:$SEQ/htslib
LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS $SEQ/src/libseqlib.a $SEQ/htslib/libhts.a"
#+end_src

Since the newest =htslib= supports reading BAM with url links in default, remember to then link any projects made with SeqLib with the additional =-lcurl= flags.

However, you can disable support for reading BAM/VCF with HTTPS, FTP, S3, Google Cloud and so on by the following:

#+begin_src shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Zilong-Li/SeqLib.git
cd SeqLib/htslib # go in htslib
./configure --disable-libcurl
cd .. # back to seqlib
autoreconf -i # build the configure script and install files it uses
./configure
make
#+end_src

*Note*: For macOS users, please link to dynamic lib if having issues. See https://github.com/samtools/htslib/issues/1176#issuecomment-722033848
