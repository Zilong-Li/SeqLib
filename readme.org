#+TITLE: A maintained SeqLib for interface to htslib only

This is a fork of https://github.com/walaj/SeqLib  supporting htslib only for dealing with BAM/CRAM/VCF/BCF.

* Installation

For quick and simple installation, just do

#+begin_src shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Zilong-Li/SeqLib.git
cd SeqLib
./configure
make
#+end_src

Now you can integrate SeqLib into your project as the following:

#+begin_src shell
SEQ=<path_to_seqlib_git_repos>
C_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH:$SEQ:$SEQ/htslib
LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS $SEQ/src/libseqlib.a -lhts -L$SEQ/htslib"
#+end_src


To add support for reading BAM etc with HTTPS, FTP, S3, Google Cloud and so on, you must compile and link with =libcurl=;

#+begin_src shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Zilong-Li/SeqLib.git
cd SeqLib
./configure --enable-libcurl
make
#+end_src

Remember then to then link any projects made with SeqLib with the additional =-lcurl= and =-lcrypto= (no need for macOS) flags.
